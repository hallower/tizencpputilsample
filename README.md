# tizencpputilsample
Tizen Native Sample REST Client application.

## Description
This project is a sample REST client application which is displaying weather information in the Gear S2.
Managing the REST invocation, by using the cURL library to create, read, update and delete the REST APIs and the cJSON to parse the result of REST invocation.
Additionally, this is designed to use the C APIs of C++ weather information retrieving  implementations from the regular Tizen native application.
So this can be used to refer to use C++ implementation in a Tizen native application and reuse some classes of this project such as RESTIvoker, JSONParser wrapper and so on.
